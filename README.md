# Blender Cross-Sectional Image Script

This script automates the creation of cross-sectional images from STL files using Blender. It positions a plane to intersect the STL object and captures orthographic views for each cross-section.

## Prerequisites

- Blender (tested with version 3.4)
- Python (comes with Blender)

## Usage

1. **Install Blender**: Ensure you have Blender installed.
2. **Run the Script**: Open Blender, go to the scripting tab, and load this script.
3. **Modify Paths**: Update the paths in the `setup_paths` function to match your file locations.
4. **Execute**: Run the script in Blender to generate cross-sectional images.

Below are some example cross-sectional images generated by the script:
